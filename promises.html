                Dancing in the night light and talking with the moon <br>
                In my heart you are mine whether its midnight or noon <br>
                Passing by every temple I pray to God to make you mine <br>
                Swear to God that girl you are simply gorgeous and divine <br>

                <br>
                In my mind you are engraved and no one can ever erase <br>
                Know I am not good enough but every challenge I am ready to face <br>
                Handing my every prayer to God for you just to make you my girl <br>
                And I promise I will always support you in life in every twist and twirl <br>
